# Phase Gate Reviews

**Project**: PM-Agents Multi-Agent System
**Purpose**: Formal reviews at each phase transition to ensure quality and readiness

---

## Phase Gate Review Framework

Each phase gate review assesses:
1. **Deliverable Completeness**: Are all required deliverables complete?
2. **Quality Standards**: Do deliverables meet quality criteria?
3. **Risk Acceptability**: Are risks identified and mitigated?
4. **Resource Availability**: Are resources available for next phase?
5. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Do stakeholders support proceeding?

**Decision Options**:
- ✅ **GO**: Proceed to next phase
- ⚠️ **GO with Conditions**: Proceed but address specific items
- ❌ **NO-GO**: Return to current phase, address issues
- ⏸️ **HOLD**: Pause project pending external factors
