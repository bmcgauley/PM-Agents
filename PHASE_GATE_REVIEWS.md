# Phase Gate Reviews

**Project**: PM-Agents Multi-Agent System
**Purpose**: Formal reviews at each phase transition to ensure quality and readiness

---

## Phase Gate Review Framework

Each phase gate review assesses:
1. **Deliverable Completeness**: Are all required deliverables complete?
2. **Quality Standards**: Do deliverables meet quality criteria?
3. **Risk Acceptability**: Are risks identified and mitigated?
4. **Resource Availability**: Are resources available for next phase?
5. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Do stakeholders support proceeding?

**Decision Options**:
- ✅ **GO**: Proceed to next phase
- ⚠️ **GO with Conditions**: Proceed but address specific items
- ❌ **NO-GO**: Return to current phase, address issues
- ⏸️ **HOLD**: Pause project pending external factors

### 2. Quality Standards ✅

#### Documentation Quality

**Criteria**: Clear, comprehensive, actionable documentation
- [x] All documents use consistent formatting (Markdown)
- [x] Technical terms defined (MCP, A2A, PMBOK, etc.)
- [x] Cross-references between documents working
- [x] No broken links or missing sections
- [x] Professional writing quality
- [x] Appropriate level of detail for audience

**Assessment**: ✅ **QUALITY STANDARDS MET**

#### Architectural Soundness

**Criteria**: Architecture is feasible, scalable, and well-designed
- [x] Clear separation of concerns (Coordinator, Planner, Supervisor, Specialists)
- [x] Agent responsibilities well-defined and non-overlapping
- [x] Communication patterns documented (A2A via MCP)
- [x] Scalability considered (can add more specialist agents)
- [x] Technology choices justified (Anthropic Claude, Ollama, MCP, Qdrant)

**Assessment**: ✅ **ARCHITECTURE IS SOUND**

**Note**: Current implementation files (pm_coordinator_agent.py, pm_ollama_agents.py) use PMBOK phase pattern, NOT the documented hierarchical architecture. This will be addressed in Phase 2-3 during redesign and implementation.

#### Use Case Completeness

**Criteria**: Use cases cover primary target users and are detailed
- [x] 6 detailed use cases documented
- [x] Use cases span multiple agent types:
  - UC1: Spec-Kit Agent (project initialization)
  - UC2: Frontend Coder + Qdrant Vector (code generation)
  - UC3: Python ML/DL + Browser (model training)
  - UC4: Research + Frontend Coder (best practices)
  - UC5: R Analytics + Reporter (analytics dashboard)
  - UC6: Full orchestration (complete project lifecycle)
- [x] Use cases have clear flows and success criteria
- [x] Use cases address real user needs

**Assessment**: ✅ **USE CASES ARE COMPREHENSIVE**

#### Stakeholder Coverage

**Criteria**: All relevant stakeholders identified and engaged appropriately
- [x] Internal stakeholders identified (5 team members)
- [x] External stakeholders identified (9 groups)
- [x] Power/Interest analysis completed
- [x] Engagement strategies defined
- [x] Communication channels established
- [x] Success metrics defined

**Assessment**: ✅ **STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS COMPLETE**

---

### 3. Risk Acceptability ✅

#### Risk Identification

**Criteria**: Major risks identified across all categories
- [x] Technical risks identified (7 risks)
- [x] Integration risks identified (2 risks)
- [x] Project management risks identified (2 risks)
- [x] Adoption risks identified (1 risk)
- [x] Risk scoring methodology defined (Probability × Impact)

**Assessment**: ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE RISK IDENTIFICATION**

#### Risk Mitigation

**Criteria**: Each HIGH risk has concrete mitigation strategies
- [x] R1: API Rate Limits - Caching, Ollama fallback, rate limiting
- [x] R2: MCP Server Reliability - Health checks, retry logic, graceful degradation
- [x] R6: Claude Code Integration - Automated installation, validation, fallback to CLI
- [x] R8: Scope Creep - Strict phase gates, MVP definition, feature freeze dates
- [x] R10: Inadequate Testing - TDD, multi-level testing, CI/CD, canary deployments

**Assessment**: ✅ **HIGH RISKS ADEQUATELY MITIGATED**

#### Fallback Mechanisms

**Criteria**: Clear fallback plans if primary approaches fail
- [x] Primary: Ollama local models (when Claude API unavailable)
- [x] Secondary: Degraded mode (alternative MCP implementations)
- [x] Tertiary: Manual mode (CLI without orchestration)

**Assessment**: ✅ **FALLBACK MECHANISMS DEFINED**

**Overall Risk Assessment**: ✅ **RISKS ARE ACCEPTABLE WITH MITIGATIONS**

2. ✅ Contact Claude Code team to introduce project
3. ✅ Apply for cloud credits (AWS/GCP/Azure)
4. ✅ Set up development environment (Docker, Qdrant, dependencies)

**SHOULD DO (Week 2 of Phase 2)**:
1. ✅ Complete specialist onboarding (if recruited)
2. ✅ Finalize agent specifications (all 12 agents)
3. ✅ Design communication protocol
4. ✅ Create development environment setup script

### Critical Success Factors for Phase 2

1. **Complete agent specifications** for all 12 agents (3 orchestration + 9 specialists)
2. **Define message schemas** for A2A communication
3. **Design MCP tool integration** approach for each agent
4. **Create detailed implementation plan** for Phase 3
5. **Maintain alignment** on architecture (avoid scope creep)

### Risks to Monitor in Phase 2
