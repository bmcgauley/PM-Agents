## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Assess which agents align with your project needs
2. **Prioritize**: Choose 2-3 high-priority agents to implement first
3. **Implement**: Create agent classes following the existing BaseAgent pattern
4. **Test**: Delegate sample tasks to new agents
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on agent performance

---

## Implementation Template

When creating new agents, follow this pattern:

```python
class NewAgent(BaseAgent):
    """
    Agent for [specific purpose].

    PMBOK Phase: [phase]
    Delegated by: [parent agent]
    """

    def get_system_prompt(self) -> str:
        return """
        You are a [specialized] agent responsible for:
        - [responsibility 1]
        - [responsibility 2]

        PMBOK Phase: [phase]

        Key Deliverables:
        1. [deliverable 1]
        2. [deliverable 2]

        Best Practices:
        - [practice 1]
        - [practice 2]

        Available MCP Tools:
        - [tool 1]: [usage]
        - [tool 2]: [usage]
        """

    def _execute(self, task: str, context: dict) -> dict:
        # Implementation
        pass
```

Register with Supervisor:
```python
self.agents["new_agent"] = NewAgent(self.client)
```
