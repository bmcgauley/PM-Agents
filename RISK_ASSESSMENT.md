## Technical Risks

### R1: API Rate Limits and Costs 🟡 HIGH
**Probability**: Very Likely (4) | **Impact**: Significant (3) | **Score**: 12

**Description**:
Anthropic Claude API has rate limits and usage costs. Excessive API calls during development and production could:
- Hit rate limits causing service disruptions
- Generate unexpected high costs ($500-5000/month)
- Block development and testing workflows

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Implement caching layer**
   - Cache agent responses for identical requests
   - TTL: 15 minutes for planning, 1 hour for documentation
   - Reduces API calls by ~40-60%

2. **Use Ollama fallback**
   - Configure automatic fallback to local Ollama models
   - Use Ollama for development and testing
   - Reserve Claude API for production and critical tasks

3. **Implement rate limiting**
   - Track API usage per hour/day
   - Queue requests when approaching limits
   - Alert when usage exceeds 80% of limits

4. **Optimize prompts**
   - Reduce token usage through prompt engineering
   - Use structured outputs to minimize verbose responses
   - Implement context pruning for long conversations

5. **Set usage budgets**
   - Hard cap: $1000/month
   - Alert at: $750/month (75%)
   - Automatic throttling at 90%

**Monitoring**:
- Daily API usage dashboard
- Cost tracking per agent type
- Weekly cost review

**Contingency Plan**:
- If costs exceed budget: Switch to Ollama-first mode
- If rate limits hit: Queue system with exponential backoff

### R2: MCP Server Reliability 🟡 HIGH
**Probability**: Likely (3) | **Impact**: Significant (3) | **Score**: 9

**Description**:
Agents depend on external MCP servers (filesystem, github, brave-search, qdrant, puppeteer). Failures could:
- Block agent operations
- Cause task failures and retries
- Degrade user experience

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Health checks**
   - Ping MCP servers every 60 seconds
   - Detect failures within 1 minute
   - Auto-restart failed servers when possible

2. **Retry logic with exponential backoff**
   ```python
   max_retries = 3
   backoff_multiplier = 2
   initial_delay = 1s
   # Retry at: 1s, 2s, 4s
   ```

3. **Graceful degradation**
   - If github MCP fails: Use local git commands
   - If brave-search fails: Use cached results or skip research
   - If qdrant fails: Use filesystem search as fallback

4. **Circuit breaker pattern**
   - Open circuit after 5 consecutive failures
   - Half-open after 30 seconds (test with single request)
   - Close circuit if request succeeds

5. **Local MCP server monitoring**
   - Log all MCP requests/responses
   - Track success rates per server
   - Alert on <80% success rate

**Monitoring**:
- MCP server uptime dashboard
- Success rate metrics per server
- Average response time tracking

**Contingency Plan**:
- If MCP server down >5 minutes: Switch to fallback implementation
- If multiple servers failing: Pause orchestration, alert user

### R3: Context Window Limits 🟠 MEDIUM
**Probability**: Very Likely (4) | **Impact**: Moderate (2) | **Score**: 8

**Description**:
Claude Sonnet has 200K token context window. Complex projects with large codebases could:
- Exceed context limits causing truncation
- Lose important context mid-conversation
- Degrade agent decision quality

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Smart context management**
   - Prioritize recent and relevant messages
   - Summarize older conversation history
   - Remove redundant information

2. **Vector-based context retrieval**
   - Use Qdrant Vector Agent to fetch only relevant code
   - Semantic search for similar patterns
   - Don't dump entire codebase into context

3. **Hierarchical context passing**
   - Coordinator: High-level summaries only
   - Planner: Task descriptions and success criteria
   - Supervisor: Agent assignments and progress
   - Specialists: Task-specific context only

4. **Token budgets per agent**
   - Coordinator: 20K tokens
   - Planner: 40K tokens
   - Supervisor: 30K tokens
   - Specialists: 60K tokens each
   - Reserve: 50K tokens for responses

5. **Context compression**
   - Compress code snippets (remove comments, whitespace)
   - Use file references instead of full content
   - Summarize previous agent outputs

**Monitoring**:
- Track token usage per request
- Alert when usage >150K tokens (75%)
- Log context truncation events

**Contingency Plan**:
- If approaching limit: Trigger aggressive summarization
- If limit hit: Split task into smaller sub-tasks

### R4: Agent Communication Failures 🟠 MEDIUM
**Probability**: Likely (3) | **Impact**: Moderate (2) | **Score**: 6

**Description**:
A2A (agent-to-agent) communication could fail due to:
- Malformed message formats
- Network issues between agents
- Timeout waiting for agent responses
- Lost messages in transit

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Message schema validation**
   - Validate all messages against JSON schemas
   - Reject malformed messages with clear errors
   - Log validation failures for debugging

2. **Message acknowledgment system**
   - Sender waits for ACK from receiver
   - Resend if no ACK within timeout (30s)
   - Log unacknowledged messages

3. **Timeout handling**
   - Default timeout: 60s for planning, 120s for execution
   - Configurable per agent type
   - Graceful timeout with partial results

4. **Message queue with persistence**
   - Store messages in queue (Redis, SQLite)
   - Persist across system restarts
   - Replay failed messages

5. **Dead letter queue**
   - Move repeatedly failed messages to DLQ
   - Alert on DLQ items
   - Manual investigation and replay

**Monitoring**:
- Message success rate dashboard
- Average response time per agent
- DLQ size alerts

**Contingency Plan**:
- If agent unresponsive >2 minutes: Restart agent
- If repeated failures: Escalate to Coordinator for decision

### R5: Codebase Indexing Performance 🟠 MEDIUM
**Probability**: Likely (3) | **Impact**: Moderate (2) | **Score**: 6

**Description**:
Qdrant Vector Agent must index entire codebases. Large projects (10K+ files) could:
- Take 30+ minutes to index
- Block other agents waiting for context
- Consume excessive memory (8GB+)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Incremental indexing**
   - Index only changed files on updates
   - Track file hashes to detect changes
   - Full reindex only when necessary

2. **Parallel indexing**
   - Index files in parallel (4-8 workers)
   - Use multiprocessing for embedding generation
   - Batch insert to Qdrant (100 vectors at a time)

3. **Smart file filtering**
   - Ignore: node_modules, .git, build artifacts
   - Prioritize: source code, documentation
   - Skip: binary files, images, videos

4. **Progressive indexing**
   - Index critical files first (entry points, core logic)
   - Index remaining files in background
   - Allow search on partially indexed codebase

5. **Index caching**
   - Cache embeddings to disk
   - Reuse embeddings for unchanged files
   - Reduces indexing time by 80%+

**Monitoring**:
- Indexing time per project
- Vector count in Qdrant
- Memory usage during indexing

**Contingency Plan**:
- If indexing >10 minutes: Show progress, allow cancellation
- If memory issues: Reduce batch size, sequential processing
